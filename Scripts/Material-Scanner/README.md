# Material Scanner Script
This script automates the usage of the Material-Point-Scanner.

# Setup
1. Have a Material-Scanner attached to your ship and properly wired up. You do NOT need to change the default field-names.
2. Have a Button of type 1, with it's ButtonState-Field renamed to "Active". (Yes this isn't a really descriptive name, but this way everything can keep the default names.)
3. Have a text-panel with it's field renamed to "Materials"

# Usage
1. Press the "Active"-Button. The Scanner is now on and will continously try to scan (until you re-press the button).
2. Aim the scanner at an asteroid
3. The scanner will now scan the asteroid, print it's content on the text-panel and then shut-off.
