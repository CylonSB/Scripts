scripts: 
  - resource-count.yolol
# optional: stop execution once one of the listed global variables has the given value.
# this is checked after every executed line, which means the line which sets the done-variable is executed completely before stopping the VM
# default is "done: 1"
# optional: if true, ignore runtime-errors during script-execution. Default: false
ignoreerrs: true
# optional: Stop execution after running set amount of lines (per script)
# default value is 2000. Set to -1 for unlimited

cases:
