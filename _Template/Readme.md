# Template

This folder is a template for scripts. To add a new script to the library copy this folder, rename it and modify the files.

Every folder **must** contain a `readme.md` file (like this one) which explains what the script is for and how to use it. It also **must** contain one or more `.yolol` files containing the script. You **may** include a `Development.md` file with extra technical notes about the script which may be helpful for other developers attempting to extend or modify the script.

### Inputs

After the introduction, which explains what the script does, you should include details about every input the script reads and every output the script writes. For example:

 - `:b`: A number
 - `:c`: A number

### Outputs

 - `:a`: The sum of `:b` and `:c`

### Credits

You may include a section crediting the developers involved in writing the script. e.g.

 - Martin Evans (Discord: Martin#2468 aka Yolathothep)
