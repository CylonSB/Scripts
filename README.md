## Contributing

To contribute a new script copy the `_Template` folder, modify it to include your script and submit a Pull Request to [this](https://github.com/CylonSB/Scripts) Github repository. Once it passes all of the automated tests contact someone in the CYLON discord server to request a final review before merging it.
